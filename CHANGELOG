Changes in jVamp v1.3 since the previous release v1.2

 * Remove RealTime.dispose() method: RealTime is no longer implemented
   with a native handle, as it was too onerous to manage in practice.
   Now the only class on which you need to call dispose() is Plugin.

 * Add getPluginPath method
 * Add build support for Visual C++ on Windows

Changes in jVamp v1.1 since the previous release v1.0
